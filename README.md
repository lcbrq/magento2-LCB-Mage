# Magento 1 Mage class in Magento 2

### version: beta

The purpose of the plugin is to emulate Mage class with \LCB\Mage\Model\Mage call allowing easier Magneto 1 themes port into Magento 2.  

Such pattern is obviously wrong as well object manager usage, but well... Customers and their budget. Good for some pages for preview anyway.
